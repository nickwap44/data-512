    "With COVID-19 continuing to be a pressing issue for people across the world, it is imperative to further our understanding of factors that play into how this virus spreads and populations that are most vulnerable. As a Washington state resident, I decided to focus my research on how COVID-19 has been effecting my region specifically. Having a clearer understanding about how we can predict potentially poor outcomes can be beneficial in deciding where to distribute our resources. Therefore, for my final project I developed a model to predict poor COVID-19 outcomes (death per capita) by Washington State county based on known COVID-19 risk factors such as age, racial/ethnic makeup, gender distribution, income per capita, population density, pre-existing health conditions, and access to healthcare. Analysis has been completed examining how these factors effect COVID-19 spread and hospitalizations, but to my knowledge, there has not been a predictive analysis such as the one I have proposed. A predictive model would be beneficial to furthering our understanding from multiple angles. From a prediction standpoint, it would indicate which counties are especially susceptible to poor COVID outcomes. This information could be used to understand where medical and virus prevention resources would best be allocated. As a secondary outcome, this type of model could also give some indication about which regressors are most significant in predicting poor outcomes. Finally, I hope to learn if the predictive model for Washington State is informative for counties across the country that are located in states with similar COVID-19 guidelines (California) and less restrictive guidelines (Florida). Worse performance in states with less restrictive guidelines could be a reflection of the impact of the differing policy decisions."

    "COVID-19 is an area of active study at this point across the globe due to its immense impact on public health, safety, and the economy. Not all Americans are at an equal risk of infection and poor outcomes, however. My decision to perform this study was heavily influenced by the work of [Chin et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7276037/) who examined the county-level differences in COVID-19 risk factors across the United States. This paper and the works it cites were the basis for my selection of variables that represent risk factors for COVID-19. There are disparities in appropriate medical resources across counties that can determine [outcomes of patients effected with COVID-19](https://qventus.com/blog/predicting-the-effects-of-the-covid-pandemic-on-us-health-system-capacity/). There is also data that reflects the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on [people of color](https://www.propublica.org/article/early-data-shows-african-americans-have-contracted-and-died-of-coronavirus-at-an-alarming-rate). [Age](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130) and [pre-existing health conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm) are recognized as important biological risk factors. [Population density](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/03/19/this-chart-shows-why-the-prison-population-is-so-vulnerable-to-covid-19), [health insurance coverage](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-267.pdf), and [poverty](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20180817.901935/full/) were also considered to be important risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this study examined county-specific characteristics across the country, I believe that it is important to scale down to the local level to examine trends in the data. As a Washington resident, I wanted to narrow my focus to Washington counties. Because many COVID-19 guidelines are set at the county and state levels, it is of utmost importance to understand which counties in our state are being most impacted and what the drivers behind these poor outcomes are. The paper did not include an extension to develop a predictive model of poor outcomes which I believe could help inform where resources should be distributed. My hope is to fill this gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond understanding what factors are most important in determining COVID-19 outcomes, I think it is important to see how factors that have a heavy influence in Washington state, where guidelines around COVID-19 are fairly strict, compare to counties in states with similar and different guidelines. Examining model performance in these counties can provide insight into how universal these risk factors are in COVID-19 outcomes, and shed light on how different state responses might be introducing some variability into the equation."

    "To answer the research questions listed above, I completed the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Clean and organize the data**: I combined the data sources listing COVID-19, demographic, population density, income, health insurance, and diabetes prevalance data into final datasets for each state. This required organizing the counties into rows with columns for average age, gender makeup, racial/ethnic makeup, income per capita, population density, percentage of uninsured individuals, prevalence of diabetes and COVID-19 death per capita. For the gender and racial/ethnic makeup, calculated '% of county population that is female' and '% of county population that is non-white', respectively. I will screen the counties to look for missing data. If a county does not have a complete dataset, I will either remove them from the analysis or impute values if it makes sense to do so. I will look for outliers across the dataset, and if there have been any mistakes in data reporting I will remove that county from the analysis. I will generate similar tables for California and Florida data to be used for the third research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Complete an exploratory data analysis**: I examined the variables to see if they are normally distributed or are correlated with one another. I determined if they are linearly associated with the outcome variable, or if any of the variables needed to be transformed. At this stage, I determined what type of model will be appropriate for the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Design a model and assess performance**: I selected ridge regression as the model for the dataset because it allowed for prediction, but also transparency in which regressors are most important in predicting poor outcomes. I examined varying values of the alpha parameter to see which performs most accurately for prediction. I trained the model by completing a train/test data split. I assessed accuracy by examining mean-squared error because the outcome variable is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Apply model to counties from other states**: While still training the model on Washington state county data, I assessed the performance of the model across counties in California and Florida. These produced mean-squared error values for each state to determine the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Draw conclusions**: At this stage, I summarized my findings from the three research questions that were asked and proposed avenues for further research."

    "Distributions for the features and response variable were plotted. Deaths per capita is relatively normally distributed, although there are few outliers. A log transform was applied to the response. Although some information is obscured by doing so (i.e. __ unit increase of X equals 1 unit increase of deaths per capita), I felt it was still appropriate because the model is trying to estimate poor outcomes. Deaths per capita is just a proxy measure in the first place."

    "I selected ridge regression as the most appropriate model for predicting poor COVID-19 outcomes in Washington state counties. This decision was based on a few factors. The features (after transformation) are approximately normally distributed and appear to have a linear relationship with the response variable. Ridge regression is able to handle collinearity which was seen among some of the variables from the correlation matrix. Ridge regression will penalize some of the variables, but unlike lasso regression, none will be removed from the model. Therefore, it can be observed which features were most important in predicting poor outcomes (research question 2)."

    "### Washington State County Predictive Model Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean-squared error was used to evaluate model performance. A mean-squared error of 1.658 was reported for predicting poor outcomes on Washington state counties in the test set. It is important to remember that the deaths per capita (used as a proxy for poor outcomes in each county) was log-transformed before the model was run in order to have the variable emulate a normal distribution. Also, the variable was standardized beforehand. Thus, the error is representative of the difference in the z-score between the prediction and the actual value of the log of deaths per capita. An R^2 value of 0.237 was reported which indicates that the model explains 23.7% of the variability of the response data around the mean. The model fits the dataset reasonably well given the amount of variability and factors that go into COVID-19 poor outcomes, however the model is not very accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: Which of the associated COVID-19 risk factors are most important in predicting poor outcomes on a per county basis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis 2: Age, pre-existing health conditions, and population density will prove to be significant and positively associated with predicting poor COVID-19 outcomes on a per county basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: How well does our model, trained on Washington state counties, predict poor outcomes in counties of other states with similar COVID-19 restrictions (i.e. California) and those with less restrictions (i.e. Florida)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis 3: Our model will produce outcomes with similar accuracy in the state with similar COVID-19 restrictions and less accuracy where restrictions are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Most Influential Factors in Predicting Poor Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "The most influential factor in the model was median age which was negatively associated with the outcome variable (coefficent value = -0.713). The log of population density (coefficent value = -0.158) and log of the percentage of the population that were non-white (coefficent value = -0.025) were also negatively associated with the outcome variable. The percentage of the population that was uninsured (coefficent value = 0.057) and the percentage of the population that was diagnosed with diabetes (coefficent value = 0.191) were positively associated with the outcome variable. While median age and population density were important to the model, the negative relationship was surprising. Pre-existing health conditions (as measured by the percentage of the population with diabetes) was positively associated as predicted in the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Performance for California and Florida\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean-squared error of the Washington state model for California counties was 1.565 and the R^2 value was 0.234. These results are very comparable to the findings for the Washington state county test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean-squared error of the Washington state model for Florida was 5.713 and the R^2 value was -5.464. This indicates an extremely poor fit for the model on Florida data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings are in line with what we expected in the hypothesis. The model fit California counties almost identically and was unable to fit Florida counties."

    "## Discussion/Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the findings, it was clear that factors such as age, population density, racial identity, pre-existing health conditions, and access to healthcare can be used to explain poor outcomes to a certain degree. However, it is certainly not capturing the full picture as evidenced by the predictive accuracy. With this model, Washington state officials could have a general idea as to which counties might be more at risk to poor outcomes. However, this would not be a tell-all measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median age being negatively associated with poor outcomes was a surprising result. Based on previous research, all factors included in the model would be expected to be positively associated with predicting poor outcomes. COVID-19 tends to have a higher mortality rate for the elderly populations so it was expected that a higher median age would be representative of a higher deaths per capita. I believe that median age may not be capturing the picture fully. Because we are collecting data on a county level, it is possible that places with more young people are spreading COVID-19 at a higher rate due to more mobility which in turn results in more poor outcomes. The negative association between the poor outcomes and population density could be explained by attitudes and COVID-19 guideline adherence. With a smaller population, it is possible that individuals in these counties do not feel the need to adhere to social distancing rules. It is also possible that a major outbreak in a small community could skew the results. Because of extremely high collinearity, percent of the population that is female and income per capita needed to be removed from the model in order to achieve accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected, the Washington state county model fit much better to the California counties than the Florida counties. I think that the reasoning is two-fold. First, California has implemented very similar guidelines to Washington state in regards to the COVID-19 response. Florida has not implemented restrictive guidelines resulting in breaches of mask wearing and social distancing. The second reasoning is a result of scaling the model to a small sample size of Washington counties. Almost all counties within Florida had much higher rates of poor outcomes as compared to Washington state. Therefore, even if the features of the counties had similar values, the model would not predict the extremes of the Florida poor outcomes as visualized in the residual error plot. This point goes to show that it is not appropriate to generalize models that are on a small scale to fit situations that are outside the scope of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were a number of limitations in this study. The feature set for the model was not exhaustive in attempting to predict COVID-19. Policy data, mobility data, and more accurate representations of metrics like pre-existing health conditions and access to healthcare would have greatly improved the accuracy. This was shown by the relatively small amount of variance that could be explained by the model. The sample size was also incredibly small for forming the basis of a predictive model. There are only 39 counties across Washington state, so the training set was exceptionally small. Another source of variability introduced by the data was that the population and demographic numbers were largely estimated based on values that were collected for the 2010 census."

    "After compiling COVID-19 and demographic data from Washington state counties and designing a predictive model, it is clear that it a highly accurate model of poor COVID-19 outcomes was not able to be constructed. However, the model does explain a degree of the variance. With the complexity of the spread of COVID-19, this information could potentially be used by policymakers to partially inform decisions about which counties might be most at risk. It is also clear that median age, population density, racial identity, pre-existing health conditions, and access to healthcare are relevant in the predictive model. However, median age was surprisingly negatively correlated with the response. The model was also just as accurate predicting poor outcomes in California counties but did not fit to the Florida dataset. This provides evidence to support the theory that machine learning models need to be grounded within the context of the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research could examine this model at a national scale. One of the major limitations of the study was the small sample size. Examining county-level features across the entire country would also allow for correcting for vast differences in poor outcomes and a more generalizable model to fit across the whole country. Another avenue for exploration would be to bring in variables such as mobility data or policy data to fine tune the algorithm for higher predictive accuracy. I would also like to set up a data visualization in the future that could show poor COVID-19 outcome risks by county on an interactive map. It would also be helpful to be able to integrate a live update feature that could accept COVID-19 data as it is reported by the states and adjust the model accordingly."
